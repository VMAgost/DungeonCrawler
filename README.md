# Dungeon Crawler Game

## Introduction

This project was a teamwork assignment at CodeCool: We had to create a dungeon crawler-style video game using the JavaFX library.
Even though it is a demo, we consider it finished, however small patches may be released from time to time.  
Thank you for checking it out! 

## Installation guide

You will need at least Java JRE 8 or JDK 16 to be able to execute the program.  
Both are recommended to be installed for a flawless gameplay.  
Preferably, you may download the RAR file and use WinRAR to unzip the same contents.  
Please read the help text carefully for a gameplay introduction and other useful hints.

## How to play

After installing the necessary prerequisites, navigate to your downloads or wherever the JAR is downloaded and double click it to execute.  
If the window resolution is not acceptable, press F11 or Alt+Enter to switch to fullscreen.  
While in-game, press Q to exit. Please check the in-game instructions and the help text included with the game file fore more help.  
See the top right corner in the game window for controls.

## Features, tech stack

The game's core is fully Java and the frontend is made by using the JavaFX library.  
We used IntelliJ IDEA as work environment and we were mostly pair programming.
